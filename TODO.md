Description:
I am looking for someone to parse data from an ESPN data URL feed and translate it into tables. Here is a link to a google doc that explains the project in detail. I've also included a sample script file that is similar to what I want. Please contact me if you have any questions.

What I'd like to do is hire you now so you can start working on this project. But I am only going to ask you do do 2 of the data sets. The reason for this is I want to make sure you understand it correctly and can do it. The payment for the project with only 2 data sets will only be $100. IF you do it correctly, I will create another job that I will pay you $150. For that job I will have you finish the rest of the data sets. There will be about 30 in total.

How does that sound to you?

These are the two data sets I will have you do for the first job.

actually I will make the first milestone the two data sets. If you do well on the first milestone I we can continue the project.
